## Overview

Derivative portfolio management is the art and science of running a book of options and other derivative instruments. Unlike a simple equity portfolio, a derivatives book has nonlinear exposure to multiple risk factors — delta, gamma, vega, theta, rho — and managing these "Greeks" simultaneously is what separates competent practitioners from theoretical observers.

This material covers the practical challenges of options book management: how to think about hedging, when to delta-hedge versus accepting risk, how gamma and vega interact, and the real-world frictions that make textbook hedging strategies impossible to execute perfectly.

## Why This Matters

Derivatives are central to modern finance — from risk management to structured products to volatility trading. Understanding how to manage a portfolio of options gives you a practitioner's lens on risk that equity-only investors simply don't have. Even if you never run an options book, understanding Greeks sharpens your intuition about convexity, nonlinearity, and the price of insurance.

## Key Takeaways

- Greeks are not independent — gamma, vega, and theta are deeply interconnected
- Delta hedging is a dynamic, not static, process with real transaction costs
- Portfolio-level Greeks can behave very differently from position-level Greeks
- Vol surface dynamics (skew, term structure) create opportunities and risks that flat-vol models miss
- Practical hedging is about managing P&L variance, not eliminating all risk

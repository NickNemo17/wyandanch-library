## Overview

Physical and Financial Commodities covers the structure, economics, and trading of commodity markets -- a domain that operates by fundamentally different rules than equity and fixed income markets. Unlike stocks and bonds, commodities are physical goods with storage costs, transportation logistics, seasonal supply and demand patterns, and unique pricing dynamics driven by the term structure of futures curves. This module examines both the physical side (production, storage, transportation, and delivery) and the financial side (futures, options, swaps, and structured products) of commodity markets.

Central concepts include the term structure of commodity futures (contango vs. backwardation), the theory of storage (which links spot prices, futures prices, storage costs, and convenience yields), roll yield (the return generated by rolling expiring futures contracts), and the role of commercial hedgers versus financial speculators in determining futures prices. The module covers major commodity sectors -- energy, metals, agriculture, and soft commodities -- and examines how supply-demand fundamentals, geopolitics, weather, and inventory cycles drive prices in each.

## Why This Matters

Commodities are a distinct asset class with return drivers, risk characteristics, and portfolio diversification properties that differ fundamentally from financial assets. Understanding commodity markets is essential for macro investors, multi-asset portfolio managers, and anyone analyzing industries that depend on commodity inputs (energy, mining, agriculture, manufacturing). The term structure and roll yield dynamics are particularly important for anyone trading commodity futures or evaluating commodity-linked investment products.

## Key Takeaways

- Commodity prices are driven by physical supply-demand fundamentals, storage economics, and the convenience yield of holding inventory.
- Contango (futures price above spot) and backwardation (futures price below spot) reflect the market's view on storage costs, convenience yields, and expected future supply-demand balance.
- Roll yield -- positive in backwardation, negative in contango -- is a major component of returns from commodity futures investments.
- Each commodity sector has unique fundamentals: energy markets are shaped by OPEC and geopolitics, metals by industrial demand and mine supply, agriculture by weather and crop cycles.
- Commodities provide portfolio diversification because their returns are driven by real economy factors that are largely uncorrelated with equity and bond returns.

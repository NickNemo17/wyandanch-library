## Overview

Market microstructure is the study of how orders become trades — the mechanics of price discovery, order book dynamics, information asymmetry, and the economics of liquidity provision. While most investors think about *what* to buy, microstructure focuses on *how* to buy it: the difference between the two can be the difference between profit and loss.

This material covers order book mechanics, the role of market makers, information leakage, adverse selection, and the empirical regularities of trade and quote data. It bridges the gap between abstract efficient markets theory and the messy reality of how prices actually form.

## Why This Matters

Transaction costs are not just commissions — they include market impact, adverse selection costs, and timing costs. For any strategy that trades frequently or in size, understanding microstructure is critical. Even for fundamental investors, understanding how your orders interact with the market can significantly improve execution quality.

## Key Takeaways

- Price discovery happens through the interaction of informed and uninformed traders
- Market makers profit from the bid-ask spread but face adverse selection from informed flow
- Order book depth and resilience determine how much you can trade without moving the price
- Information is reflected in prices through a dynamic process, not instantaneously
- Optimal execution requires balancing urgency against market impact

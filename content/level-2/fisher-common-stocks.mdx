## Overview

Philip Fisher's *Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits* (1958) is one of the most influential books on growth investing ever written. Fisher introduced the concept of "scuttlebutt" -- a systematic method of gathering qualitative intelligence about a company by interviewing its customers, suppliers, competitors, and former employees. His approach was revolutionary at a time when most security analysis focused narrowly on financial statements and quantitative ratios.

At the heart of the book are Fisher's famous "Fifteen Points to Look for in a Common Stock," a checklist covering everything from a company's growth potential and profit margins to its management depth, R&D spending, and labor relations. Fisher argued that truly outstanding companies -- those capable of compounding earnings for decades -- are rare, and that investors should concentrate their portfolios in a small number of such businesses rather than diversifying broadly. His philosophy of buying wonderful companies and holding them for the long term profoundly influenced Warren Buffett and an entire generation of growth-oriented investors.

## Why This Matters

Fisher's qualitative framework complements the quantitative rigor of traditional value analysis. In an era of abundant financial data, his emphasis on primary research, management assessment, and competitive positioning remains highly relevant. The scuttlebutt method is essentially the predecessor of modern due diligence, and his fifteen-point framework provides a structured way to evaluate whether a company has the characteristics of a long-term compounder.

## Key Takeaways

- The scuttlebutt method: gather intelligence from a company's ecosystem (customers, suppliers, competitors, employees) to build a qualitative mosaic.
- Fisher's 15 points provide a comprehensive checklist for evaluating growth companies, covering markets, margins, management, and R&D.
- Concentrate portfolios in a small number of outstanding companies rather than diversifying into mediocrity.
- The best time to sell is almost never -- truly great companies can compound for decades if their competitive advantages remain intact.
- Qualitative research on management integrity, innovation culture, and competitive positioning is at least as important as quantitative analysis.

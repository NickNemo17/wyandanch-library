## Overview

Howard Marks' memos to Oaktree Capital clients, written over more than three decades, are among the most respected practitioner writings in the investment world. In these memos, Marks develops and refines his thinking on risk, market cycles, investor psychology, and the concept of "second-level thinking" -- the idea that successful investing requires thinking differently and better than the consensus, not just knowing more facts. The memos were later distilled into his book *The Most Important Thing*, but the original letters contain a richness and immediacy that the book cannot fully capture.

Marks is a credit investor by training, and his perspective on risk is particularly distinctive. He argues that risk is not volatility but the probability of permanent capital loss, and that the greatest risk arises when investors believe there is no risk. His analysis of market cycles -- the pendulum swinging between fear and greed, between risk tolerance and risk aversion -- provides a practical framework for understanding where we stand in any given market environment and how to position accordingly.

## Why This Matters

Marks' memos are essential reading for anyone managing capital in public or private markets. His frameworks for thinking about risk, cycles, and contrarian positioning are directly applicable to portfolio construction and risk management. In a world where most investors are trapped in consensus thinking, Marks' emphasis on second-level thinking and cycle awareness offers a genuine edge.

## Key Takeaways

- Second-level thinking: to outperform, you must have a view that is both different from the consensus and correct -- simply agreeing with the crowd produces average results.
- Risk is not volatility -- it is the probability of permanent loss, and it is highest when perceived risk is lowest.
- Market cycles are driven by psychology: the pendulum swings between euphoria and panic, and understanding where you are in the cycle is critical.
- The relationship between price and value determines expected returns -- buying assets below intrinsic value is the most reliable path to outperformance.
- Defensive investing (avoiding losers) is often more important than aggressive investing (finding winners), especially in credit markets.

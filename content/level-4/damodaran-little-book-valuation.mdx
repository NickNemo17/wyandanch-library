## Overview

Aswath Damodaran's *The Little Book of Valuation* distills the essential principles of business valuation into an accessible, practitioner-oriented guide. Damodaran, a professor at NYU Stern and widely regarded as the leading authority on valuation, covers the two fundamental approaches to determining what a business is worth: intrinsic valuation (estimating value based on a company's expected future cash flows, discounted to the present) and relative valuation (pricing a company by comparing it to similar companies using multiples like P/E, EV/EBITDA, and price-to-book).

The book walks through the mechanics of building a discounted cash flow (DCF) model -- estimating growth rates, determining the cost of capital, projecting free cash flows, and calculating terminal value -- while also addressing the practical challenges that make valuation as much art as science: dealing with uncertainty, adjusting for different business types (financial services firms, cyclical companies, young growth companies), and understanding the biases that creep into every valuation. Damodaran emphasizes that valuation is not about precision but about building a framework for making better investment decisions under uncertainty.

## Why This Matters

Valuation is the central skill of investing. Whether you are analyzing a public equity, evaluating a private company, or assessing an acquisition target, the ability to estimate intrinsic value and compare it to market price is what separates informed investment decisions from speculation. Damodaran's framework is the industry standard, and understanding both intrinsic and relative valuation methods is essential for any analyst or portfolio manager.

## Key Takeaways

- Intrinsic value is the present value of expected future cash flows -- every asset's value ultimately comes from the cash it generates.
- A DCF model requires estimates of cash flows, growth rates, cost of capital, and terminal value, each of which involves judgment and uncertainty.
- Relative valuation (multiples) is useful for quick comparisons but can be misleading if the comparable companies are themselves mispriced.
- Valuation is not about getting a precise number -- it is about building a range and understanding the key drivers that determine where in that range the true value lies.
- The biggest valuation errors come from biases: anchoring to current prices, using unrealistic growth assumptions, or ignoring the cost of capital.

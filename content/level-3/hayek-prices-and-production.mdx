## Overview

Friedrich Hayek's *Prices and Production* (1931) is the foundational statement of the Austrian theory of the business cycle and a direct intellectual challenge to the Keynesian framework. Based on a series of lectures delivered at the London School of Economics, the book argues that business cycles are not caused by insufficient aggregate demand but by distortions in the structure of production created by artificial credit expansion. When central banks push interest rates below the natural rate, they induce entrepreneurs to undertake longer, more roundabout production processes that are unsustainable given the actual level of voluntary saving in the economy.

Hayek builds on the capital theory of Bohm-Bawerk and the monetary theory of Mises to show how credit-fueled booms lead to systematic malinvestment -- capital is allocated to projects that appear profitable at artificially low interest rates but cannot be completed or sustained when rates normalize. The inevitable bust is not a market failure but a necessary correction, as the economy liquidates malinvestments and realigns the structure of production with genuine consumer preferences and available savings. The book's triangle diagrams illustrating the stages of production became one of the most recognizable visual tools in Austrian economics.

## Why This Matters

Hayek's framework offers a powerful alternative lens for understanding financial crises, asset bubbles, and the unintended consequences of monetary policy. Investors who understand the Austrian business cycle theory can better identify periods when artificially cheap credit is distorting asset prices and capital allocation, and can anticipate the corrections that follow. The 2008 financial crisis, the post-COVID asset bubble, and recurring boom-bust cycles in real estate and venture capital all exhibit dynamics that Hayek's framework helps explain.

## Key Takeaways

- Artificial credit expansion (interest rates below the natural rate) distorts the structure of production and causes malinvestment.
- Booms driven by cheap credit are not genuine prosperity -- they represent a misallocation of capital into unsustainable projects.
- The bust is a necessary correction: malinvestments must be liquidated for the economy to realign with genuine saving and consumer preferences.
- Prices, including interest rates, are information signals -- manipulating them through monetary policy distorts the information that entrepreneurs rely on for investment decisions.
- Capital is heterogeneous and has a time structure; ignoring this complexity (as aggregate demand models do) leads to fundamental misunderstandings of how economies grow and contract.

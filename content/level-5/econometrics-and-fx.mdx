## Overview

This module covers the intersection of econometric methods and foreign exchange markets, two areas that are deeply intertwined in quantitative finance. The econometrics component focuses on time series analysis -- autoregressive models (AR), moving average models (MA), ARIMA, cointegration, and error correction models -- as well as cross-sectional and panel regression techniques commonly used in empirical finance. These tools form the backbone of empirical research in asset pricing, macroeconomic forecasting, and strategy development.

The FX component examines the structure and dynamics of the foreign exchange market, the largest and most liquid financial market in the world. Topics include exchange rate determination (purchasing power parity, interest rate parity, balance of payments models), the carry trade and its risk-return profile, central bank intervention, and the microstructure of FX trading. The combination of rigorous econometric technique with deep domain knowledge of currency markets provides a powerful framework for analyzing macro-driven investment opportunities.

## Why This Matters

Time series econometrics is the primary empirical tool for quantitative researchers working with financial data. Understanding how to properly specify, estimate, and test models on time-indexed data -- while avoiding the pitfalls of spurious regression, non-stationarity, and data mining -- is critical for any credible quantitative research. FX markets, meanwhile, are the transmission mechanism for global macro forces and offer unique opportunities (and risks) that differ fundamentally from equity and fixed income markets.

## Key Takeaways

- Time series models (AR, MA, ARIMA, VAR) capture the temporal dynamics of financial data and are essential for forecasting and signal generation.
- Cointegration and error correction models allow researchers to identify long-run equilibrium relationships between non-stationary series.
- Non-stationarity, serial correlation, and heteroskedasticity are pervasive in financial data and must be properly handled to avoid spurious results.
- FX markets are driven by interest rate differentials, capital flows, central bank policy, and risk sentiment -- understanding these drivers is key to currency analysis.
- The carry trade (borrowing low-yield currencies to invest in high-yield currencies) is one of the most studied strategies in FX and illustrates the tension between persistent returns and tail risk.

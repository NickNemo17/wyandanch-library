## Overview

Gappy Lecture 3 addresses factor evaluation -- the rigorous assessment of whether a factor is genuinely predictive of returns or merely a statistical artifact. This is arguably the most critical step in quantitative research, because the vast majority of "discovered" factors fail to hold up under scrutiny. The lecture provides a systematic framework for evaluating factor robustness, statistical significance, economic rationale, and susceptibility to crowding and decay.

Key topics include statistical significance testing (t-statistics, Bonferroni corrections, false discovery rate control), robustness checks (stability across subperiods, geographies, and market regimes), the replication crisis in empirical finance (many published factors do not survive out-of-sample), and the practical challenges of factor crowding -- when too many investors pursue the same factor, its returns degrade and its drawdowns deepen. The lecture also covers factor timing (can you predict when a factor will perform well or poorly?) and the decay of alpha (how quickly does a signal lose its predictive power after discovery?).

## Why This Matters

The proliferation of published factors (the "factor zoo") has created a crisis of credibility in empirical finance. Hundreds of factors have been documented in academic papers, but only a small fraction are economically meaningful and robust enough to trade. The ability to critically evaluate factors -- separating genuine premia from data-mined noise -- is essential for any quantitative researcher or allocator evaluating systematic strategies.

## Key Takeaways

- Statistical significance is necessary but not sufficient: a factor must also have economic rationale and survive robustness tests.
- The factor zoo problem: hundreds of published factors, most of which are likely false discoveries driven by data mining.
- Robustness testing includes subperiod analysis, out-of-sample testing, cross-country validation, and sensitivity to construction choices.
- Factor crowding degrades returns and increases drawdowns -- understanding capacity constraints and investor positioning is critical.
- Alpha decay means that even genuine signals lose predictive power over time as markets adapt; continuous research and refinement are necessary.

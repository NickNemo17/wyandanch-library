## Overview

Systematic Indices explores the design, construction, and evaluation of rules-based investment indices that go beyond traditional market-capitalization weighting. This module covers the evolution from passive cap-weighted benchmarks to "smart beta" and factor-tilted indices, which systematically overweight securities with characteristics associated with higher expected returns -- value, momentum, quality, low volatility, and size. The curriculum examines both the theoretical foundations (why certain factors earn premia) and the practical engineering (how to construct, rebalance, and manage an index in production).

Key topics include index construction methodology (weighting schemes, rebalancing frequency, liquidity and capacity constraints), the distinction between risk premia and alpha, the role of indices as benchmarks and investable products (ETFs, index funds), and the challenges of factor timing, crowding, and decay. The module also covers the institutional landscape: how index providers (MSCI, FTSE, S&P) design and govern their products, and how the growth of passive investing has reshaped market structure and price discovery.

## Why This Matters

Systematic indices are the foundation of the modern investment management industry. Trillions of dollars track cap-weighted and factor-tilted benchmarks, and understanding how these indices are constructed, what biases they embed, and how they interact with market dynamics is essential for both passive and active investors. For quantitative practitioners, index construction is a core skill that directly translates to portfolio construction and factor-based strategy design.

## Key Takeaways

- Cap-weighted indices are the default benchmark but embed a systematic overweight to the most expensive stocks by construction.
- Smart beta indices tilt toward factors (value, momentum, quality, low volatility) that have historically earned risk-adjusted premia.
- Index construction choices (weighting, rebalancing, reconstitution) have material effects on returns, turnover, and capacity.
- Factor crowding -- too much capital chasing the same systematic strategy -- can erode returns and increase drawdown risk.
- Understanding the distinction between systematic risk premia (compensated by bearing risk) and alpha (genuine skill) is critical for evaluating any index or strategy.

## Overview

Gappy Lecture 1 focuses on alpha research -- the systematic process of generating, testing, and refining trading signals that predict future asset returns. Alpha research is the core intellectual activity of quantitative investment management: identifying patterns in data that represent genuine, exploitable inefficiencies rather than statistical noise. This lecture covers the full alpha research pipeline, from initial hypothesis generation through signal construction, statistical testing, and evaluation of economic significance.

Central concepts include the information coefficient (IC) -- the correlation between a signal's predictions and subsequent realized returns -- and the fundamental law of active management, which relates a strategy's information ratio to the breadth of independent bets and the skill (IC) of the forecasts. The lecture also addresses the critical challenge of multiple testing: when researchers test many signals on the same data, some will appear significant by chance alone. Proper correction for multiple comparisons, out-of-sample validation, and economic reasoning are essential safeguards against false discoveries.

## Why This Matters

Alpha research is what quantitative funds do. The ability to generate, test, and evaluate predictive signals in a disciplined, statistically rigorous framework is the most valuable skill in systematic investing. Understanding the information coefficient, the fundamental law, and the pitfalls of data mining is essential for any researcher or portfolio manager working in a quantitative framework.

## Key Takeaways

- Alpha signals are systematic forecasts of future returns derived from data -- the quality of these signals determines portfolio performance.
- The information coefficient (IC) measures predictive skill; even small but consistent ICs can generate significant value when applied across many securities.
- The fundamental law of active management: IR = IC x sqrt(breadth) -- skill and the number of independent bets jointly determine performance.
- Multiple testing is the greatest threat to alpha research: testing many hypotheses on the same data will produce spurious "discoveries."
- Robust alpha research requires out-of-sample testing, economic intuition, and healthy skepticism about backtest results.

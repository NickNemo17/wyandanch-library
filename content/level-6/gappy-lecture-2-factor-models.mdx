## Overview

Gappy Lecture 2 covers factor models -- the mathematical and economic frameworks used to decompose asset returns into systematic components (factors) and idiosyncratic residuals. The lecture centers on the Fama-French factor model and its extensions, which attribute returns to exposure to market risk (beta), size (SMB -- small minus big), value (HML -- high minus low), profitability, and investment factors. Factor models serve as both explanatory tools (understanding why a portfolio performed the way it did) and constructive tools (building portfolios with desired factor exposures).

The curriculum covers factor construction methodology -- how to define, measure, and build long-short factor portfolios from raw data -- as well as risk decomposition, which breaks down a portfolio's risk into contributions from each factor exposure plus an idiosyncratic component. The lecture also addresses the ongoing debate between risk-based and behavioral explanations for factor premia: are value and momentum premia compensation for bearing systematic risk, or do they arise from persistent investor biases and institutional frictions?

## Why This Matters

Factor models are the lingua franca of modern portfolio management. Every institutional investor, risk manager, and quantitative researcher uses factor decompositions to understand portfolio exposures, attribute performance, and manage risk. Understanding how factors are constructed, what they represent economically, and how to use them in portfolio construction is a non-negotiable skill for working in quantitative finance.

## Key Takeaways

- Factor models decompose returns into systematic (factor) and idiosyncratic components, enabling precise risk attribution and portfolio analysis.
- The Fama-French model identifies market, size, value, profitability, and investment as key systematic return drivers.
- Factor construction requires careful methodology: defining sorts, handling data, managing turnover, and ensuring robustness across time and markets.
- Risk decomposition reveals whether a portfolio's returns are coming from intended factor bets or unintended exposures.
- The risk vs. behavioral debate remains unresolved: understanding both perspectives helps practitioners evaluate factor crowding and sustainability of premia.

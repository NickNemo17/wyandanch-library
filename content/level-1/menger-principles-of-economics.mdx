## Overview

Carl Menger's *Principles of Economics* (1871) is the founding text of the Austrian School of economics. In this groundbreaking work, Menger dismantles the classical labor theory of value and replaces it with the theory of subjective value -- the idea that the value of a good is not determined by the labor or materials that went into producing it, but by the importance an individual places on the satisfaction it provides. This single insight restructured the entire framework of economic reasoning and laid the groundwork for marginal utility analysis.

Menger systematically builds from first principles: he defines what makes something an economic good, introduces the concept of orders of goods (consumer goods vs. producer goods), and develops his theory of marginal utility to explain how individuals make choices under scarcity. His analysis of the origin of money -- as an emergent institution arising from barter rather than government decree -- remains one of the most elegant explanations in all of economics.

## Why This Matters

Menger's framework is essential for any investor or analyst who wants to understand pricing at a foundational level. Subjective value theory underpins modern demand analysis, and his insights on the spontaneous emergence of institutions (money, markets, prices) provide a powerful lens for understanding why financial markets organize the way they do. His work is the entry point into Austrian economics, which offers a distinct and often contrarian perspective on credit cycles, capital allocation, and entrepreneurial judgment.

## Key Takeaways

- Value is subjective: goods have value because individuals judge them useful for satisfying wants, not because of embedded labor costs.
- Marginal utility explains pricing: the value of additional units of a good declines as quantity increases, which drives exchange ratios.
- Goods exist in orders: first-order goods satisfy wants directly; higher-order goods (capital, raw materials) derive value from their contribution to producing first-order goods.
- Money emerged spontaneously from barter as the most marketable commodity, not by government fiat.
- Economic reasoning must start from the actions and valuations of individuals -- methodological individualism.
